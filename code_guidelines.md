# Our Mantra

Readable, Simple, Minimal, and Modern code is our focus. This basically means we want to prioritise readability more than anything else, we prefer simplicity over performance, we never add code unless it's actually needed, and we make sure to use the latest C# and .NET features where applicable. Most of this boils down to following clean code principles.

# General Guidelines

When reviewing code, consider the following:
- Is the code easy to read and understand?
- Does the code overcomplicate things?
- Could any surplus functionality be removed?
- Are there any modern C# or .NET features that could be used to improve the code?
- Is the code consistent with the rest of the codebase?
- Are there any code smells present?
- Does the code follow general best practices?
